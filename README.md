# Reinforcement-Learning-on-UAVs
Realize The Automation of UAV Cluster by Reinforcement Learning Approach
This project implemented and tuned a WoLF-PHC machine learning algorithm with the underlying reinforcement learning principle, to increase the automation degree of UAV group by allowing each UAV in a group be an independent learning machine to form a totally decentralized system, and also by increasing the cooperation within the UAV group when performing a task.
THis project utilized matplotlib to visualize the result data.
